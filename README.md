*Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning*

This project is a machine learning model developed using scikit-learn (sklearn) on the breast cancer dataset available within sklearn. The goal of this project is to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign based on various features. Below is the documentation to guide you through the project.

### Project Structure
1. *breastcancer-ML-SKlearn.ipynb*: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
2. *README.md*: Documentation file (you're reading it now).ed to run the project.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

### Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook breast_cancer_ml.ipynb.
2. Follow the code cells sequentially to understand data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
3. Modify hyperparameters or experiment with different algorithms as desired.
4. Run the code cells to execute each step.

### Data
The breast cancer dataset used in this project is available within scikit-learn's datasets module (sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()). This dataset contains 569 instances with 30 features each, representing various attributes of breast cancer tumors.

### Model
The machine learning model used in this project is a classification model trained to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on the provided features. The following algorithms are implemented and compared for performance:
-  Naive Bayes (NB)
- Gaussian NB

### Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy: Overall accuracy of the model on the test set.
- Precision: Ability of the model to avoid false positives.
- Recall: Ability of the model to identify all relevant cases.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer tumors based on their features. Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance the model or experiment with different algorithms for improved performance.
